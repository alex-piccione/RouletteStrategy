The strategy suggest:
- Bet against the dozen that is not appeared in the last 5 spins.

This is counterintuitive because for the law of big numbers the distribution over the dozens tend to be uniform in a long period 
thus it makes more sense to to think that the "missing" dozen is a favourite. Why bet against it?

The strategy suggest:
- I used a standard martingale (doubling bet) [...] I prefer an incremental betting structure ...
Like what, which one. How to calculate the next bet ?
