# Roulette Strategy
Practice with F# while test some Roulette strategies


I bought this item on ebay:  
> "ROULETTE SYSTEM - Safe Easy Roulette Dozens Strategy | £480 Profit!" 

I was just curious to see what this kind of "strategy" can be.
Essentially it says to bet agains the dozen that didn't appeared in the previous 5 spins.

I think, this is counterintuitive for the law of big numbers because we now that with a high number of events the distribution will be uniform on the possibilities.  
Anyway I wrote a console application that simulate playing that strategy.
